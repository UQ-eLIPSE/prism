# Please don't delete comments below until we are familiar with manually trigerring Github Actions.
# This workflow is to be used for testing only.
# Currently github Actions UI only displays Actions in the default branch ie main branch.
# If a new workflow is added in .github/workflow dir and pushed in a new branch, it can't be tested.
# But we can use this workaround to test it.
# This workflow(deploy.yml) is in main branch and hence available in all branches to test manually.
# To test a new workflow in a branch, just add the workflow code here without deleting these comments.
# Run Workflow button will be avaialble as long as workflow_dispatch is present.
# Clicking Run Workflow button after selecting feature branch will run this workflow manually from feature branch.
# Once the new workflow is tested in its branch, pls add the workflow to a new file in .github/workflow dir.
# Once the new workflow file is merged to main branch, it will be avaiable as a new Action in github Actions UI.
# After testing, comment all lines in this workflow so that it doesn't trigger any deployments.
